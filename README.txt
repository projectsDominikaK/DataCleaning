This data set '1_Survey_raw data' is from a real survey. It has data about current job position and salary range of participants. Also how happy they are with their jobs on different levels and if they made the switch to a Data job, or what are they looking for in a job now. The table has also some demography, education, age and gender data.

Some of the columns had too long titles therefore they were slightly rename in Notepad++ creating '2_Survey_renamed columns'.

The data were clened in MySQL mainly, the steps are writen in the code '3_Data Clenaing in MySQL' from where the '4_Survey_edit' was exported.

Only the salary range was edited in PowerBI and a new column with average salary was created, see '5_PowerBi visualization'.
